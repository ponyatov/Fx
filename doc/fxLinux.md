# fxLinux
## minimized standalone runtime
### soft-realtime distributed OS

- `fx` engine runs in a stable predictable environment
  - no any unpredictable updates and behaviour changes
  - no paid components or commercial OS licensing (MIT)
- soft-realtime message-based interop in local networks
- low-layered I/O without thick abstractions
  - uses SDL for cross-platform portability
    - runs a guest mode in Windoze trash
